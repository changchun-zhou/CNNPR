WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

WARNING: [Route 35-459] Router was unable to fix hold violation on 1 pins. This could be due to a combination of congestion, blockages and run-time limitations. Such pins are:
